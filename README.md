# Userscripts

Some userscripts for use with [Tampermonkey][tm] or [Greasemonkey][gm].

Click the "Raw" button on a file and Tampermonkey should take over installing
the script. Greasemonkey probably works similarly.

## Bookmarklets

[Bookmarklets on GitHub Pages][bm]

Contains scripts that make more sense as bookmarklets than as userscripts.
